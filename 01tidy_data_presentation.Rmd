# Introduction

## Goals for this talk

My goal is for you to walk away with an understanding of:

 - Tidy data philosophy
 - Some [__`tidyverse`__](https://www.tidyverse.org/) data terminology
 - Common types of _untidy_ data
 - Operations for tidying data in __`R`__
 - Displaying tidy data

## Where did this come from?

Most of what follows is based off of [Hadley Wickham's paper](http://vita.had.co.nz/papers/tidy-data.pdf) on tidy data.

If you're looking for a practical introduction, [Hadley Wickham has one of those too](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/tidy-data.html).

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width='35%'}
knitr::include_graphics('./memes/hadley_tidy_data.jpg')
```

I also borrow from other resources (listed at the end), as well as my own experience working with tidy _and_ untidy datasets.

## But mostly...

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width='80%', out.height='80%'}
knitr::include_graphics('./memes/fed_up_niles2.png')
```

# Idea (the theory)

## Why tidy data?

 - Consistency
 - Rely on vectorization (in `R` and `pandas`), and expected/desired behavior in grouped aggregation (excel, tableau)
 - Foresight
 - It's never been easier

## What is tidy data?

There are three qualities a dataset must have to be considered "tidy":

 1. Each variable forms a column.
 1. Each observation forms a row.
 1. Each type of observational unit forms a table.


## The Language of Tidy Data

 >- Dataset: a collection of values (e.g. [iris data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iris_flower_data_set))
 >- Variable: all values that measure the same underlying attribute (e.g. height, width)
 >- Values: a specific measurement or attribute for a variable (e.g. $100)
 >- Observation:  all values measured on the same unit (like a person, or a day, or a game) across variables

It's usually easy to figure out things like _observations_ and _variables_ for a given dataset, but defining them in the abstract can be difficult. 

## The Data Tidying Operations

Getting data into a tidy format requires understanding the three qualities of tidy data, as well as the five most common types of untidy data (more on these shortly).

Then, we can get most forms of untidy data to be tidy by utilizing four verbs of data tidying

  - [`gather`](https://tidyr.tidyverse.org/reference/gather.html): takes multiple columns, and gathers them into key-value pairs - it makes "wide" data longer
      + See also: [`pivot_longer`](https://tidyr.tidyverse.org/reference/pivot_longer.html) (supersedes `gather` as of [September 2019](https://www.tidyverse.org/blog/2019/09/tidyr-1-0-0/))
  - [`spread`](https://tidyr.tidyverse.org/reference/spread.html):  takes two columns (key & value) and spreads into multiple columns - it makes "long" data wider
      + See also: [`pivot_wider`](https://tidyr.tidyverse.org/reference/pivot_wider.html) (supersedes `spread` as of [September 2019](https://www.tidyverse.org/blog/2019/09/tidyr-1-0-0/))
  - [`separate`](https://tidyr.tidyverse.org/reference/separate.html): turns a single column that is character-valued into multiple columns, based on a regular expression or specific positions
  - [`unite`](https://tidyr.tidyverse.org/reference/unite.html): concatenate multiple columns into one

# Execution (the practice)

## Five common types of untidy data

Here are the five most common types of untidy data you're likely to experience "in the wild":

 >- Column headers are values, not variable names.
 >- Multiple variables are stored in one column.
 >- Variables are stored in both rows and columns.
 >- Multiple types of observational units are stored in the same table.
 >- A single observational unit is stored in multiple tables.

We'll go through examples of each of the five.

## For each untidy dataset...

Think about the following questions:

 >- Why is it untidy?
 >- How would you work with it without tidying it first (e.g. lots of calculated flags, hard coding, black magic)?
 >- What are the variables, values, and observations?
 >- How can we tidy it up?
 >-	How would you work with it in its tidy form?

## 1. Column headers are values, not variable names

The first dataset we'll look at comes from the WHO and displays the number of TB cases for three countries in two years.

```{r}
kable_latex(table4a %>% mutate_if(is.numeric, 
                                  scales::comma))
tb_data <- table4a
```

This data is too _wide_, as `1999` and `2000` are __values__ for a __variable__ we could call `year`.

Although difficult to analyze, this format is helpful for presentation and data entry.

## Tidying # 1

Need to [`gather`](https://tidyr.tidyverse.org/reference/gather.html) columns into key-value (year-cases) pairs:

```{r echo = TRUE}
tb_data %>%
    gather(key = year, 
           value = tb_cases, 
           -country) 
```

## Tidying #1 (using `pivot_longer`)

```{r echo = TRUE}
tb_data %>%
    pivot_longer(cols = -country,
                 names_to = "year", 
                 values_to = "tb_cases")
```


## 2. Multiple variables are stored in one column

The next table has two columns, but it should have four. How would you work with this data without tidying it first?

```{r}
hec_untidy <- HairEyeColor %>%
    as_data_frame() %>%
    unite('Hair - Eye - Sex', Hair, Eye, Sex, sep = ' - ') %>% 
    head()

hec_untidy %>%
    kable_latex()
```

The `Hair - Eye - Sex` __variable__ actually has __values__ for three separate __variables__ stored within it.


## Tidying #2 (1/2)

We need to [`separate`](https://tidyr.tidyverse.org/reference/separate.html) one column (`Hair - Eye - Sex`) into multiple columns (`hair`, `eye`, `sex`)

```{r echo = TRUE}
hec_untidy %>%
  separate(col = `Hair - Eye - Sex`,
           into = c('hair', 'eye', 'sex'),
           sep = ' - ') # actually not needed
```

## Tidying #2 (2/2)

Could go a step further and use [`uncount`](https://tidyr.tidyverse.org/reference/uncount.html) (the opposite of [`dplyr::count`](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/tally.html)):

```{r echo = TRUE}
hec_untidy %>%
  separate(col = `Hair - Eye - Sex`,
           into = c('hair', 'eye', 'sex'),
           sep = ' - ') %>% # actually not needed
  uncount(n)
```



## 3. Variables are stored in both rows and columns

This is the most complicated form of untidy data, and typically requires a bit more massaging.

```{r}
mkt_untidy <- EuStockMarkets %>% 
  as_data_frame() %>%
  head(31) %>%
  mutate(day = factor(paste0('d', 1:31), paste0('d', 1:31)),
         year = 2000,
         month = 1) %>%
  gather(stock, value, -day, -month, -year)%>%
  spread(day, value) %>%
  .[, 1:7]

mkt_untidy %>%
  kable_latex()
```

Think carefully about what the __observation__ is for this data.

## Tidying #3 (1/2)

What is the "observation" (a __day__ or a stock on a day)?

```{r echo = TRUE}
mkt_untidy %>%
    gather(day, price, starts_with('d')) %>% # wide to long
    spread(stock, price) %>% # long back to wide-ish
    mutate(day = gsub('d', '', day)) %>% # remove "d"
    unite(date, year, month, day, sep = '-') %>% # 3 cols to 1
    mutate(date = lubridate::ymd(date))
```

## Tidying #3 (1/2) (using `pivot_longer` and `pivot_wider`)

```{r echo = TRUE}
mkt_untidy %>%
    pivot_longer(cols = starts_with('d'),
                 names_to = "day",
                 values_to = "price") %>%
    pivot_wider(names_from = stock, 
                values_from = price) %>%
    mutate(day = gsub('d', '', day)) %>%
    unite(date, year, month, day, sep = '-') %>%
    mutate(date = lubridate::ymd(date))
```

## Tidying #3 (2/2)

What is the "observation" (a day or a __stock on a day__)?

```{r echo = TRUE}
mkt_untidy %>%
    gather(day, price, starts_with('d')) %>% # wide to long
    # spread(stock, price) %>% # long back to wide-ish
    mutate(day = gsub('d', '', day)) %>% # remove "d"
    unite(date, year, month, day, sep = '-') %>% # 3 cols to 1
    mutate(date = lubridate::ymd(date))
```

## 4. Multiple types of observational units are stored in the same table

This is one that gets violated a lot. Our desire is to have _all_ the data in one spot. 

First: tidy up while normalized

Then: analyze while de-normalized

```{r}
tw_data <- data_frame(
  golfer = 'Tiger Woods',
  birth_date = structure(2189, class = "Date"),
  birth_place = 'Cypress, CA',
  tournament_date = structure(c(9775, 9789, 9873, 9964), class = "Date"),
  tournament = c("Las Vegas", "Disney", "Mercedes", "Masters"),
  final_score = c("-27", "-21", "-14", "-18")) 

tw_data %>%
  kable_latex(scale_down = TRUE)
```


## Tidying #4 (use [`dplyr::select`](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/select.html))

```{r echo = TRUE, results = 'hide'}
# helper function
select_distinct <- function(data, ...){
  select(data, ...) %>%
    distinct()
}
# golfer table
golfer <- tw_data %>% 
  select_distinct(golfer, birth_date, birth_place)

# tournament table
tournament <- tw_data %>% 
  select_distinct(tournament, tournament_date)

# result table
tournament_results <- tw_data %>% 
  select_distinct(tournament, winner = golfer, final_score)
```

## 5. A single observational unit is stored in multiple tables

Have you ever worked with US government data before?

![newman_is_angry](memes//newman_angry.jpg)\

<br>

## 5. A single observational unit is stored in multiple tables

Have you ever worked with US government data before? If so, you know this is common:

```{r}
t_15 <- data_frame(year = 2015, cpi = 237)
t_16 <- data_frame(year = 2016, cpi = 240)
t_17 <- data_frame(year = 2017, cpi = 245)
```

```{r echo = FALSE}
kable(list(t_15, t_16, t_17))
```

Not hard to remedy, but still annoying and __potentially dangerous__. Easy fix for _consistent_ tables: [`dplyr::bind_rows`](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/bind.html)

```{r echo = TRUE}
bind_rows(t_15, t_16, t_17)
```

# Two Asides: Displaying and Organizing Data

## Displaying tidy data

How can we make it easier to scan raw values in a data table?

- Determine the roles of variables in your analysis (fixed by design of experiment vs. measured during course of experiment)
- Fixed variables should come first, then measured variables
    + Order from L-R by degree of fixed-ness. The "most fixed" variables are the key describers of an observation, and are useful when we're trying to scan values.
- Put related variables next to each other
- Order rows based on the first variable and then break ties with the second and subsequent (fixed) variables after that.


## Organizing data in spreadsheets

[Broman & Woo (2018)](https://doi.org/10.1080/00031305.2017.1375989) wrote a short paper with 12 tips for organizing data in spreadsheets for sharing, analysis, reproducibility, and collaboration. After reading the tidy data paper, I would recommend reading it.

\begin{columns}[T]
    \begin{column}{0.5\textwidth}
    
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Be consistent
            \begin{itemize}
               \item Codes, NA, names, ID, layout, files, dates, phrases
            \end{itemize}
            \item Write dates like YYYY-MM-DD
            \item Do not leave any cells empty
            \item Put just one thing in a cell
            \item Organize the data as a single rectangle (with subjects as rows, variables as columns, and with a single header row)
            \item Create a data dictionary
        \end{itemize}

    \end{column}
    \begin{column}{0.5\textwidth}
    
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Do not include calculations in the raw data files
            \item Do not use font color or highlighting as data
            \item Choose good names for things
            \item Make backups
            \item Use data validation to avoid data entry errors
            \item Save the data in plain text files
        \end{itemize}
        
    \end{column}
\end{columns}


# Conclusion

## Five tips to get tidy

 1. Put each dataset in a table 
    - [`data.frame`](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/base/html/data.frame.html) (`stringsAsFactors`? printing to a console? lazy evaluation?)
    - [`tibble`](https://tibble.tidyverse.org/) (the nice version of `data.frame`)
 1. Put each variable in a column
 1. Ask some questions
    - What are the rows of my dataset (observation, level of detail)?
    - Is each column a _distinct_ variable?
    - How hard would it be to calculate a grouped aggregation?
 1. Be able to describe your data set as _one row per __X__ per __Y__ per __Z__ per ..._
    - e.g. one row per iris flower, one row per household per year in which they've made a gift, one row per stock per hour per day
 1. Structure and tidy up your data to be manipulated by a computer. Ignore urges to make it easily viewed by a human.

## Wrapping up

 - Code is for _humans_, data is for _computers_ ([relevant tweet from Vince Buffalo](https://twitter.com/vsbuffalo/status/358699162679787521))
 - Be consciously aware of your __values__, __variables__, and __observations__
 - Normalization can be your friend
 - Be assertive and understanding
